 * A note on ground truth track ID indexing - VirtualKitti starts their
 * trackID's from 0 which is annoying when handling the trackID's within a
 * semantic/motion image mask since we normally expect the id's to be the exact
 * pixel values (where 0 is background).
 *
 * Instead we increase the actual trackID index to be the ground truth one (eg
 * the one provided in the poses.txt file) + 1 so we can index the trackId's
 * directly in the instance mask which will line up with the ones stored in the
 * ground truth packets (after we have +1 to their index)
